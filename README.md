I will and you will learn Makefile easily !

So what is a makefile ? 
A makefile is simply a file where we put instruction for our compiler !

## 1. Simple Makefile
	CMakeLists.txt (Your Simplest CMake code for little project).
	main.cpp is your code (c++ in this case).
		
	Now you simply need to do this command:
		cmake . (this will generate all the required files for compiling automatically).
		make (this will compile your code for you !).
