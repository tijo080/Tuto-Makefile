# Tuto-Makefile
I will and you will learn Makefile easily !

So what is a makefile ? A makefile is simply a file where we put instruction for our compiler !

In the 1. Simple Makefile folder the only two thing you need to make yourself is the main.cpp and the CMakeLists.txt when that's done you open your terminal in that folder and you do this command -> <strong>cmake .</strong> 
Now all the other file will be generated automatically so don't worry it's not so hard :D
Now you can compile easily your code with this command -> <strong>make</strong>
and up you get your executable !
